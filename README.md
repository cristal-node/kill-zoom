**Defense mechanism from zoom**

This firejail profile is from the default profile, so you should check updates from them.
Use the other file the to pass xdg links(zoommtg://zoom.us/j/123456789) 

It makes a disposable home folder in /tmp, thus it'll be deleted afterwards.

BUT STILL YOU SHOULDN'T USE ZOOM, USE SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD
